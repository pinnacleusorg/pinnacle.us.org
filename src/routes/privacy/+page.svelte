		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
			Your privacy is important to us. It is Pinnacle's policy to respect your
			privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our
			website, https://pinnacle.us.org, and other sites and/or platforms we own
			and operate.
		</p>
		<p>
			We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a
			service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your
			knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and
			how it will be used. At this point in time, the information we collect
			consists of:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Your email address - for the purpose of sending you newsletter updates
				after you directly opt in for them
			</li>
			<li>
				Your first name - for the purpose of identifying you in our
				communications
			</li>
			<li>
				Your IP address - for the purpose of identifying unique users in our
				system and preventing system abuse
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide
			you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within
			commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as
			unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
		</p>
		<p>
			We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with
			third-parties, without your explicit consent, except when required to by
			law.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any information collected for the purpose of our mailing list will be used
			solely by Pinnacle, to keep you informed on topical information. The
			information provided will not be sold or transfered to any third party
			without consent. You are able to opt out of the mailing list at any time
			by sending us an email or clicking the "opt out" link in the footer of
			every email. If you opt out, your information will be permanently deleted
			from our records.
		</p>
		<p>
			Likewise, user supplied content and information provided to Pinnacle,
			required to be provided by invited attendees, will not be transferred,
			sold, or otherwise given to third parties without prior consent and
			approval. User content and information includes, but is not limited to,
			name, date of birth, address, and uploaded profile picture. This
			information is used internally only to display data unless permitted to be
			shared with recruiters or third parties explicitly by you.
		</p>
		<p>
			We will not, and do not intend, to email you regarding anything unrelated
			to Pinnacle and its community. Messages will be sent on an infrequent
			basis, and you are always able to opt out if the mailing list becomes
			cumbersome or you are no longer interested in following Pinnacle.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please
			be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these
			sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective
			privacy policies.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the
			understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your
			desired services.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our
			practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any
			questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel
			free to contact us at legal@pinnacle.us.org
		</p>
		<p>This policy is effective as of 1 February 2020.</p>
